## Contributing

* Contributions are welcome at
  [the GitHub](https://github.com/kblankenship1989/roll20-character-sheets). Just open
  a pull request.
* You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), then go to the Dnd_5e_Helper folder and run the following
  commands in bash/cmd:
  * `npm install`
  * `npm run dev`
  
Npm is now watching all the files for changes and compiling as you go.
If you want to compile everything just once, use `npm run build` instead.
